    1.5 insertion sort   
        Insertion sort wins every time (over selection, buble sorts). It also has the benefit of not needing to have the whole array before starting, 
        which allows you to sort things in real-time as data comes in.
                
            const insertion = arr => {
            arr.forEach((item, i) => {
                let num = arr[i];
                let j;

                for (j = i - 1; j >= 0 && arr[j] > num; j--) {
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
                };
                arr[j + 1] = num;
            });

            return arr;
            };

            console.log(insertion(unsortedArr));
